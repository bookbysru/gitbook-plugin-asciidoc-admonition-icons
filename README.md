# Gitbook Plugin: Insert admonition icons

Quick plugin hack to add support for asciidoctor admonition icons in gitbook.

I initially forked (a fork of) https://github.com/erixtekila/gitbook-plugin-richquotes but what you see here bares very little resemblance to it, but provided an excellent skeleton for a neophyte.

LESS/CSS taken from the apiman.io blog theme (in turn derived from asciidoctor default them). Thanks to them.
